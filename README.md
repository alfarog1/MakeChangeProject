## Make Change Project

### Week 1 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview
In the cash register we will calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. We will also notify the attendant how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer. Change should be provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used should not be displayed.

### Technologies Used

* Java
* Eclipse

### Lessons Learned, Insights Gained
* Modulus operator helped me filter through the change I had already given.
* If statements are great for moving through conditions to help filter through a process.
* Converting an `int` to a `double` is key because when dividing two integers, Java uses integer division. In integer division, the result is also an integer. The result is truncated (fractional part thrown away) and not rounded to the closest integer.
